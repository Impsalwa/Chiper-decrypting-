# Ciper Decrypting

Cipher Decrypting also called encryption algorithms, are systems for encrypting and decrypting data. A cipher converts the original message, called plaintext, into ciphertext using a key to determine how it is done. Ciphers are generally categorized according to how they work and by how their key is used for encryption and decryption.
